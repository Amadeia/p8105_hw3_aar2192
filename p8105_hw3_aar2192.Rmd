##Problem 1 

#### Loading data from BRFSS

```{r load_data}
devtools::install_github("p8105/p8105.datasets", force = TRUE)
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

#### Cleaning BRFSS datasest

```{r clean}
brfss_smart2010_clean =
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(state = locationabbr, county = locationdesc) %>% 
  separate(county, into = c("trash", "county"), sep = " - ") %>% 
  select(-trash) %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good","Fair","Poor")))
  
```
#### In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?
```{r filter_states_2010}
brfss_smart2010_clean %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  group_by(state, year) %>%
  summarize(distinct_counties = n_distinct(county)) %>% 
  filter(distinct_counties==7)
```
Connecticut, Florida, and North Carolina were observed in 7 locations or counties in 2002.

#### Spaghetti plot for number of locations 2002-10
```{r spaghetti_plot}
spag_brfss_plot =
  brfss_smart2010_clean %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>%
  summarize(distinct_counties = n_distinct(county)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = distinct_counties, group = state)) +
    geom_line(aes(color = state))+
  labs(title = "Counties observed per year by state", x = "Time (years)", y = "Number of counties") 
  
ggsave("spag_brfss_plot.pdf", spag_brfss_plot, width = 8, height = 10)
```

#### Table showing proportion of excellent responses
